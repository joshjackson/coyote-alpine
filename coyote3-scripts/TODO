Filesystem Linkages needed:

/etc/dhcpc/ -> /opt/coyote/config/dhcpc/
/etc/resolve.static -> /opt/coyote/config/resolv.static
/etc/resolve.conf -> /opt/coyote/config/resolv.conf
/etc/httpd.conf -> /opt/coyote/config/httpd.conf
/etc/ez-ipupdate.conf -> /opt/coyote/config/ez-ipupdate.conf
/etc/ssl.d/ -> /opt/coyote/config/ssl.d/

Other fixes:

Move system configuration templates out of /opt/coyote/config/templates/ and into /opt/coyote/sysconf/templates/

Add user coyote.coyote to base system, place in wheel group, add to sudoers with no PW requirement
	- coyote user needs to be used for all firewall services as well as web server

Need to implement a new IPSEC subsystem. Strongswan?
Need to implement a new web server for webadmin. Needs to eventually support .Net Core web applications

Review /opt/coyote/config/dhcpc/dhcpc.updown interface file build process
/opt/coyote/config/dhcpc/dhcpc.updown:90, 142 -> Fix for new ipsec system needed
/opt/coyote/sysconf/includes/addons/webadmin-conf.php -> Fix for new http daemon
