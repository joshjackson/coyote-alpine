Welcome to the Coyote Linux 3.1 Technology Preview!

This installation is not yet a functional version of Coyote Linux
and is simply intended to provide a preview of some of the technologies
being developed for use in the upcoming versions of Coyote Linux.

At this time, the Coyote technology preview system is based on Alpine
Linux v3.20. A decision has not yet been made whether Coyote will be
based on a fully custom version of Linux. Alpine Linux is very close
to the design goals of Coyote and may remain as the underlying OS
for future versions.
